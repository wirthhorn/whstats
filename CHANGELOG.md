# Changelog

## v2.0.0

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed `--ytd` alias**: Year-to-date statistics now only accessible via `--year-to-date` or `-Y` (uppercase)
- **Changed `-y` meaning**: Previously `-y` was alias for `--year-to-date`, now `-y` means `--year` (past 365 days), and `-Y` (uppercase) means `--year-to-date`
- **Removed `--no-summary` / `-n` flag**: Summary is now always shown; use `--brief` for concise output
- **Removed `-s` short option**: `--setup` no longer has `-s` short option; use `--config` or `--setup`
- **Removed `-c` short option**: `--config` previously had `-c` short option and showed config location; now `--config` runs interactive setup, and `--show-config` displays settings
- **Changed `--config` behavior**: Previously showed config location (now `--show-config`); now runs interactive setup (previously `--setup`)
- **Removed `-r` short option**: `--reset` no longer has a short option; must be typed out fully as a safety measure
